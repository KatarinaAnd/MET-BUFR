# MET-BUFR

**main.py** is where the main code lies. Currently missing the keywords and probably needs to alter the global attributed. The code has only been run
for the blockNumber-function, and needs to be implemented for wigosID, stateIdentifier and movingstations as well. This _should_ be fairly simple.

**get_keywords.py** is self explanatory. Contains the function that is supposed to return the keywords for each variable

**code_tables.py** has not been implemented into the main code yet, not sure if needed. However, if needed, then this shouldn't be too hard either

**useful_function.py** contains useful functions that I've made specifically for this task.

**main_config.cfg**, configuration file. Self explanatory. However, needs a user manual or something.
